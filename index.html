        First, I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Michelle Brewington.  I love everything Pink and Green!  My birthday
        is November 30th.  I'm a Saggitarius! I am a proud graduate of TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY!  I truly love my HBCU! One of my interests is shopping. Even if it is just window shopping. My second interest
        is interior designing and party planning.  This is where I find my happy place.  I love tranforming a space into something beautiful.
        And lastly, my third interest is baking.  I love baking even though my cakes are hit or miss. I love using my husband and son as my
        guinea pigs although at times they can be brutely honest, but my neice and nephews will always tell me my cakes are delicious even if
        it tastes like cardboard! Boy do I love my babies!!! Despite it all, I keep pushing on with my baking and one day, I'm going to
        get it right!  And BOOM goes the dynamite!!!
